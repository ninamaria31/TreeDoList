# tree_do

A tree structured todo list

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Todos:
--> only focus on a task we can actually implememt. Then work the other task out but we don't have to implement it necessarily. 
- Usability Challenge:
  - Tree navigation (snapping, zooming, grid panning)
  - Task prioritization

- Connectivity Challenge:
  - Concurrent user updates on different devices
  - Merging (maybe user can also choose, or there are mergin libraries for JSON?)
